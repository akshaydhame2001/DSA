Brief about your work experience and roles or responsibilities?
What is data drift? Change in input data therefore reduction in model performance.
What are assumptions of linear regression? Linearity, Homoscedasticity, Mulivariate normality, independence, lack of multicollinearity, absence of endogeneity
what are assumptions of logistic regression? A binary or ordinal dependent variable, independent observations, linearity in the log odds, absence of multicollinearity, and a sufficiently large sample size, no outliers
Difference between Fine tuning and RAG? Training Fine-tuning involves retraining a pre-trained LLM on a new dataset, while RAG augments the LLM's knowledge with external data during inference. 
What are retrival methods? Keyword based BM25 TF-IDF, Semantic similarity Vector Embeddings
Describe chunking and tokenizing strategies? Rag chunking is dividing into manageable blocks, Tokenizing BPE words or subwords
Define Embedding? Densse vector of numbers in high dimensional space with semantic meaning
