Dwell time analysis project:

Setup:

1. Install requirements.txt
2. run inference.py
3. for creating zone use scripts/draw_roi.py
4. for custom zone and video use args (--zone_configuration_path and --source_video_path)

Edge cases:

1. Loss of track id
2. Fluctuations in FPS

Approach Used

1. Detection yolov8 nano model for real-time inference
2. Tracking with ByteTrack Tracker
3. Computes the elapsed time for each tracked object by dividing the number of frames since its first
    appearance in ROI by the FPS value of the video stream.
