Create a dict storing length of string, no. of vowels and no. of capital words for each words

import re

def analyze_sentence(sentence):
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', sentence)  # Extract words ignoring punctuation
    result = {}

    for word in words:
        length = len(word)
        
        vowel_count = 0
        capital_count = 0
        
        for char in word:
            if char.lower() in "aeiou":
                vowel_count += 1
            if char.isupper():
                capital_count += 1

        result[word] = {
            "length": length,
            "vowel_count": vowel_count,
            "capital_count": capital_count
        }
    
    return result

# Example usage
sentence = "Hello World, this is OpenAI!"
analysis = analyze_sentence(sentence)
print(analysis)
